// How to Design/Create a Singleton Class in Java?
// To create a singleton class, we must follow the steps, given below:

// 1. Ensure that only one instance of the class exists.

// 2. Provide global access to that instance by

// Declaring all constructors of the class to be private.
// Providing a static method that returns a reference to the instance.
// The instance is stored as a private static variable.

class Singleton {}

public class Example6 {
